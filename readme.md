Projet Capitrain
===

An attempt at implementing the algorithms described in the article [A framework for step-wise explaining how to solve constraint satisfaction problems](http://www.bartbogaerts.eu/articles/future/005-Expl/Zebra-Journal.pdf).

The project includes two problem definitions, one for the original Zebra puzzle in the java/Zebra.java file, and one for the pasta puzzle discussed in the article in the file java/Pasta.java.

The algorithms are located in the file java/Explainer.java.

As of now, there is only a partial implementation of the second algorithm "Candidate explanation" which tries to find all possible explanation for a fact by reasoning by contradiction.

To run the program, you can run the main method of either Zebra.java or Pasata.java
